Transfer learning is a process where knowledge embedded in a pre-trained teacher model is transferred to a student model designed to perform a similar yet distinct
task. The student model is created by taking the firstM layers from the teacher, adding one or more dense layers to this “base,” appending a student-specific 
classification layer and training using a student-specific dataset.
