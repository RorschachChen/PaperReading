Neural Cleanse detects backdoors by searching for a small perturbation that causes all inputs to be classified to a specific label, and detecting it as an anomaly
(e.g. whose anomaly index >2).

ABS detects backdoors by iteratively stimulating internal model neurons and watching for abnormal model output behaviors. If any neurons cause abnormal outputs,
ABS reverse engineers backdoor triggers that optimally activate the neuron.
